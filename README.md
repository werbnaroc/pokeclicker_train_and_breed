# pokeclicker_train_and_breed
This auto clicker is designed to train and breed pokemon while leaving pokeclicker on unattended. It will occupy your system while in use because it gives mouse input. It will click where you tell it to a certain number of times, open the breeding menu, then go back to clicking. Lining up the clicks with the breeding menu will cause the script to refill the egg queue. 

Hold 'q' to quit the script. 
Hold 'w' to open the breeding menu manually

The script is a bit slow and running a faster autoclicker at 20 clicks per second really speeds things up. 
The script and any other autoclicker have to be run as an admin to work on pokeclicker
